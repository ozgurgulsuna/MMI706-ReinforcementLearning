Development of a reinforcement learning based locomotion strategy for truss robots. This involves coordinating the movement of various parts in a specific sequence, similar to how serpents or mammals move, where intricate coordination is necessary.
The structure consists of N linear actuators,
each with a single degree of freedom
(DoF), interconnected with passive joints.
1. Model-Based/Free RL: Single
topology, baseline for comparison.
2. Modular Control Policy RL: Multiple
topology, generalizability.
3. Multi-Agent Policy RL: Each member
is an individual agent.
